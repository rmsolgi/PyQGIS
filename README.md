# [crosslines_across_line](https://github.com/rmsolgi/PyQGIS/blob/main/functions/crosslines_along_line.py)
This is a function that draws crosslines at a specific angle across a line layer.
The function receives a line layer directory, a directory to save output crosslines layer, interval of crosslines, length of crosslines, and an angle (in degree). The output crosslines layer is saved as shapefile.
